# Distance Correlation
An algorithm of distance correlation and its comparision with Pearson correlation on samples

## Some properties of distance correlation
For scalar random variables X&Y and real numbers a&b,
  1. dCor(aX+bY) = dCor(X,Y), a != 0.
  2. 0 <= dCor(X,Y) <= 1.
  3. dCor(X,Y) = 0 iff X&Y are independent.
